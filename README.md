# 🟡 Skippable

**Skippable** is a modern attendance tracker built around a simple idea:  
**you attend by default — we only track what you skip.**

No daily logging. No clutter. Just clarity.

## Why Skippable?

Most attendance apps make you log everything.  
Real life doesn’t work like that.

Skippable focuses on the moments that matter — the skips — and helps you stay in control without micromanaging your schedule.
